This application was designed as a audio plugin for common DAWs as well as to be a standalone application. 

It has a Gonio meter, Correlation meter, stereo RMS meter, stereo Peak meter, as well as two histogram plots for RMS and peak values. 

You can customize the user interface as to how you see the metering with the ticks above the meter as well as what kind of meters are displayed.

If you move the threshold bar you can set the point at which you can visually detect overages.
